# MangaScraper
I have a flight soon, and thought being able to read manga on it would be nice. So I built this super simple scraper to grab the images from how its formatted on mangareader.net and store them for me. Very easy to use.

Call with command line as so:
```shell
python scrape.py <n/e, n for new manga, e for add to existing> <folder name to put manga in> <base_url that the chapter and page numbers add to (e.g. https://www.mangareader.net/one-piece)> <start chapter> <end chapter>
```
